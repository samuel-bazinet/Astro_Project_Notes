[[PSP Script]]
## Purpose
- Study the outer corona of the sun.
	- Trace the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates solar winds
	- Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar winds
	- Explore mechanisms that accelerates and transports energetic particles
- 7 year mission (only about 17 months left).
## About the Spacecraft
* 1m x 3m x 2.3m
* 685 km wet mass
* Produces up to 343 W
* Had a reinforced carbon-carbon heatshield to protect the spacecraft from the heat of the sun when nearing perihelion.
	* Without it, the spacecraft would become inoperative within a minute

### Instruments
* FIELDS 
	* Captures the shape and scale of the electric and magnetic fields (hence the name)
- ISâ˜‰IS
	- Measures particles such as electrons, protons, and ions
	- Tracks their lifecycle to see ow they are accelerated and move through space
- WISPR 
	- Optical telescopes to image the corona and heliosphere
- SWEAP 
	- Counts the electrons, protons, and helium ions and measures their velocity, density, and temp.
## History
* Originally concept from the 50s
	* Reaffirmed later
	* Originally planned on using a gravity assist from Jupiter
		* It is much easier to escape the solar system than to reach the sun
- Announced in 2009
	- It was simply known as "Solar Probe"
- Launched August 12 2018. 
	- Fun fact: It was launched on one of the largest rocket flying despite being the size of a refrigerator (Like a restaurant one, not the one you have at home), and it still needed an extra stage to get it started for its gravity assists.
## Findings
- Observed magnetic switchbacks, where the magnetic field is reversed (Nov 2018)
- (Dec 2019) First 4 papers reporting the direction and strength of the magnetic field, described the frequent and short-lived changes in the direction of the magnetic field.
	- These confirm that Alfven waves are related to the coronal heating problem (where the corona is warmer than the surface of the sun)
- Discovered a dust-free zone of 5.6 million kilometers from the sun where the particles are vaporized by the Sun's radiation
- (April 2021) The spacecraft confirmed the location of the Alfven surface at 18.8 solar radii, which makes PSP the first spacecraft to "touch the sun".
	- It was discovered by measuring the magnetic and particles conditions.
- (Sept 2022) PSP discovered its first comet (through pictures taken by its instruments)
	- It has since found 19 sungrazing comets
## Records/Interesting Facts
- Fastest man made object (191 km/s / 0.064% of the speed of light).
- Closest object to the Sun (7.26 million km)
	- Planned to be down to 6.9 million km in 2025
- First object to enter the Sun's corona
