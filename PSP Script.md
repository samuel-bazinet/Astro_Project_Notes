# Introduction

Hello and welcome to our presentation on the Parker Solar Probe and other space telescopes. Let's not waste time and get started with the titular probe.

*Run a video of the launch*

The Parker Solar Probe was launched on the 12th of August 2018, at 3:31 am from Cape Canaveral in Florida. It used one of the largest rocket available at the time: the Delta IV Heavy. But even this large rocket wasn't enough to get close to the Sun as it needed an extra solid rocket motor to give the final push to the spacecraft. They launched at night because we all know that the Sun is much cooler then. *Pause for some laughter* In reality, this launch time was used so that the spacecraft could perform a series of gravity assists to get closer to the Sun. But this is not where the story of the Parker Solar Probe started. 

The idea of sending probe going close to the Sun originates from the late 50s. The goal was to study the particles and fields near the Sun. This was reaffirmed in the 70s and 80s but was deemed too expensive. In the 90s, a solar orbiter was planned and included a trajectory that would use a gravity assist from Jupiter to get closer to the Sun. That may seem crazy as Jupiter is much further than the Sun, but because the Sun is so massive, it is much easier to get away from it than it is to get close to it. Since Jupiter is the next largest body in the solar system, we could take advantage of its mass by using it to reduce the perihelion, which is the lowest point of the orbit around the Sun, of the spacecraft to get closer to the Sun at the end. Unfortunately, this Orbiter mission was cancelled in the early 2000s due to budgeting issues and the goals of the current American administrations. 

In the early 2010s, the solar probe project was restarted with a goal of being lower cost and was referred to as the Solar Probe Plus. This new program would use Venus for gravity assists and there would be many of those. They also raised the planned perihelion so that less thermal protection would be needed. *Show a memorial picture of Parker* The spacecraft was named after the astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who had a history of solar science, such as a mathematical theory that predicted the existence of solar winds, which is one of the core research goal of the probe. 

## Instruments

*Show a graphic of the spacecraft. Would be neat if it was a spinning model.*

The probe is about 7 meter cubed, or the size of a small car, and has a wet mass of nearly 700kg. It has a distinctive heat shield made of reinforced carbon-carbon composites. Without it, the spacecraft will not last a minute at perihelion.

The Parker Solar Probe has four main instruments: FIELDS, IS☉IS, WISPR, and SWEAP.

FIELDS, which stands for Electromagnetic Fields Investigation, which isn't an acronym but is spelled like one, uses 4 antenna extending from the heatshield and magnetometers hanging from the back oft he spacecraft to measure the electronic and magnetic field of the sun. The antennas are made of niobium as they need to resist the incredible heat of the corona of the sun. 

IS☉IS, the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun, uses 2 instruments to measure particles across a wide range of energies, such as electrons, protons, and ions. The instruments measure the particles' lifecycle and how they are accelerated and how they move through space. The instruments are contained within a dome on the side of the craft.

WISPR, the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe, is a pair of cameras used to take pictures of the corona, the inner heliosphere, or anything of interest. The cameras are hardened from radiation as there is a lot of it near the sun.

SWEAP, the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons, counts nearby particles and measures their properties such as velocity, density, and temperature. This instrument is exposes to the Sun and glows red hot when it is active. 


## Findings

*Find a visualization of magnetic switchback (Maybe this)[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Parker_Solar_Probe_flying_through_a_switchback_in_the_solar_wind.gif/330px-Parker_Solar_Probe_flying_through_a_switchback_in_the_solar_wind.gif]*

Only 4 months into its mission, Parker Solar probe observed magnetic switchbacks, where the magnetic field of the solar wind is reversed. This was the second spacecraft to experience this effect.

In December of 2019, the first four papers using the probe's data were released. Those papers reported the frequent short lived changes in direction and strength of the Sun's magnetic field. These changed confirm the correlation to Alfven waves and provide additional hints as to what causes the coronal heating problem, which is the fact that the corona of the sun is hotter than its surface.

The probe also discovered a cosmic dust-free zone of 56. million kilometers from the Sun. This is due to the intense radiation at this distance form the Sun.

In April 2021, Parker Solar Probe "touched the Sun". This may sound odd as it is still quite far from the surface of the Sun, but it did cross the Alfven surface, which is the boundary between the corona and the rest of the solar system. They determined that the probe had crossed it by measuring the change in the magnetic field and the particle conditions. They reached that boundary at nearly 19 Solar radii, meaning that the sun is almost 20 times larger than what we can see from Earth!

The probe also discovered 19 sungrazer comets. Those comets are special because their perihelion is so close to the Sun. It is quite amazing that a spacecraft meant to study the Sun also gets to look at objects from the outskirts of our solar system.

# Conclusion

There is still over a year left for the Parker Solar Probe's mission, and there is a ton of data to go through. That alone may take decades to parse and we are very excited to see what we can learn from out neighboring star!
